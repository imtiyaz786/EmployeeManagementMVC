# EmployeeManagementMVC
This repository contains source code for employee management system that follows MVC architectural pattern.

The Employee Management System acts as an application that performs CRUD operation on Employee and Department Data.
The employee and department data are managed through the API to be consumed via HttpClient Library inside the controller class.
GitHub link for the api is https://github.com/imtiyaz786/EmployeeAPI

The application follows Model View Controller architectural pattern where the entire workflow goes like this:Cn
  - User sends a request.
  - Request is received by the server and routed to the appropriate controller based on the URL and HTTP verb.
  - Controller process the request according to the business logic. In our case, it retrieve data from the EmployeeAPI.
  - Controller updates the model.
  - Controller passes the model to the appropriate view and the view will render the html or other content to be sent back to the client.
  - The reponse or content generated by View will be sent by the server to the client.
